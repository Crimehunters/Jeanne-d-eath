[center]On her journey, she had a knight companion with her. 



The knight wishes to help Jeanne from her suffering, with his might and experience he’ll certainly help Jeanne achieve her goal.






Arriving at the abandoned castle, the plan was to negotiate with the False Apostle himself. 






However, the False Apostle did not share the same idea, he instead cast his power to the knight.




The knight suffered and couldn’t control himself, madness had eaten him.





Now Jeanne must release him from this madness.








 Sorrow Awaits….
